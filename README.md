## Continuous Brand Lift
---
This project estimates the **continious** and **contemporaneous** Brand lift (as measured by Brand Searches i.e., Searches related to a particular brand) due to spending on Social Media (or any other Channel for that matter)

It isolates the impact on the Brand Searches due to Spend on any one Channel

### Actual Brand Searches

We first see the Actual Brand Searches over Time

### Brand Search Uplift 
Based on the Total Spends per channel, we estimate the Counterfactual (i.e., the Brand Searches that we would have had if we had not spend on a particular Channel)

The Difference between Actual (Blue) and the Conterfactual (Red) is the actual uplift in the Brand Searches due to investments in a particular Channel
